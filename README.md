We used the RNA-seq count matrix from GEO accession GSE248760 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE248760) to predict differential gene expression patterns based on upstream promoter and enhancer sequences, aiming to identify early indicators of ischemic stroke risk in sickle cell patients.
